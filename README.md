## Introduction
This repository houses a spam email detection model implemented using TensorFlow and Python. The project aims to automatically classify emails into spam and non-spam categories, leveraging machine learning techniques provided by TensorFlow.

## Installation
To get started with the spam email detection model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tahaalikhan123/Spam-Email-Detection-With-Tensorflow-And-Python-Dependancies.git
    cd Spam-Email-Detection-With-Tensorflow-And-Python-Dependancies
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the spam email detection model, follow the provided example in the `example_usage.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. You can make predictions using the trained model on new email data.

## Model Training
The model was trained using the dataset from Kaggle, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email). The training process involved preprocessing the data and utilizing TensorFlow for building and training the model.

## Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve. To visualize the ROC curve and confusion matrix, follow the steps in the `evaluation.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset for training and testing the model was sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email).
